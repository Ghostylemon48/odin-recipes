        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A classic dessert with macerated strawberries on top of a shortcake with whipped cream topping. The dessert emphasizes the sweetness and juiciness of strawberries</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
           <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
           <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (<em>Optional</em>)</li>
           <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cubed</li>
           <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
           <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit (230 degrees celsius). Grease an 8-inch baking pan</li>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the milk and eggs to a small bowl and beat them together. Stir it into the flour mixture until batter is just blended. Spread the batter evenly into your prepared baking pan</li>
            <li>Once preheated, bake it in the oven for 15 minutes or until golden. Let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
