        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb ground sirloin</li>
            <li>1 lb sage-flavored pork sausage</li>
            <li>2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 oz pepperoni, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) can fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (12 oz) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lb lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>16 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground beef and sausage until brown, crumbling as it cooks (roughly 5-7 minutes). Add jalapeno, onion, and garlic and cook, while stirring often, until the vegetables are softened (about 3 minutes). Add in pepperoni, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, and water and mix until thoroughly combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cook, uncovered, while stirring occasionally while pasta is prepared.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit (180 degrees celsius).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Once boiling, cook the lasagna noodles, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender but firm to the bite (about 8 minutes). Drain the noodles.</li>
            <li>Coat a 9x13-in baking dish with cooking spray. Evenly spread a thin layer of sauce across the bottom of the dish. Then layer it with your pasta noodles, 1/2 of your ricotta, and 1/3 of your mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with 1/3 of your grated Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of your sauce. Repeat the process for the next layer, then finish it with the remaining sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Once preheated, bake until browned around the edges and bubbly (about 40 minutes).</li>
        </ol>
