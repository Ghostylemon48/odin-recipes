# odin-recipes

This is a test website for the 'Recipes' project within the HTML section of The Odin Project.

Throughout this project I will be testing my HTML skills. Here's a list of the knowledge I will be using.

- Proper HTML boilerplate
- Establish the version of html used through <!DOCTYPE html>
- Optimize accessibility by setting a default language and character set. This assists the browser in translating the page into different languages with their proper special characters
- Use proper formatting through the appropriate usage of elements such as headers, paragraphs, and lists
- Use proper file organization for my pages and additional resources
- Provide safe and secure hyperlinks outside of the website if necessary.
- Include hyperlinks to various pages within the website
- Include images with relevant 'alt' text
